# RUMMY
An attempt to make a simple CLI version of the card game-Rummy.
Another Odd day at College, my hostel neighbor came up to me and gave me a task,"Hey Dude, Can you code Rummy??"
I was like, "Well that's interesting! Lemme give it a try...."
And so we have this!!üòÅ

P.S.- I have never really played  any card came so if there's any fishy game logic, feel free to raise issues, 
suggestions are always welcome.

To run the program download the python script, navigate to the downloaded directory and run the following command:<br>
<br>
python rummy.py
